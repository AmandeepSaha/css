            <h2>Kolkata</h2>
            <p>
                Kolkata, still commonly referred to as Calcutta, is the capital of India’s eastern state of West Bengal.
                It’s now known for its gentle pace of life, but back in the 18th century, the city was British India’s
                most important trading post and the showpiece of colonial power.

Being one of the main tourist destinations of West Bengal, housing the Cooch Behar Palace and Madan Mohan Temple, it has been declared a heritage city.
